# Session 4
 - We sleep and wake up in the morning.
 - Everything is very very still and flat
 - There is amound that we're slowly drifing towards, definitely a village of sorts.
 - Flat landscape cris crossed with rivers
 - Think we're in the orthodoxy
 - As we get closer to the village, an see a fairly bigish village with a couple of stone towers, manor house, a norman church.
 - Don't see any people, looks like the back end is higher, we're aproaching from the bottom
 - Looks like it's in the middle of a lake.
 - A jetty with some sunk fishing boats.
 - Another jetty with a couple of boats
 - A stone arched bridge that joins on to a bit of a causeway.
 - Water might become a lot higher
 - Round this side seems to be mostly seawall.
 - The boat is cruising in a certain direction
 - Head to the sunken Jetty
 - Someone singing and a man in a breastplate
 - Man in breast plate starts to walk towards the jetty we're coming in
 - Looks Tudor breast plate, dented and old, but not rusty, a long straight sword.
 - Wearing clothes that are a long way out of fashion, horribly pock mar - Sir John
 - Silent Bell can't talk to you at the moment, there is trouble, there's been trouble.
 - You are welcome to stay in teh village, if you leave the village, you are not welcome to come back 
 - Everyone's goneif anyone comes here, everything is normal or nobody leaves alive.
 - There are people who don't belong in the village who are here 
 - the few people who lived here are gone
 - If people come here everything is normal or everyone is dead
 - A walled compound an overgrouwn compound, a very old wall, with a stone at an angle, covered in cletic style carving.
 - Have a feeling of "I've got there" that journey is over.
 - Shops are all a bit broken, there's been a fire some time ago.
 - Inn looks abandoned - picture of two swans, having a fight over something invisible between them.
 - Let's try the inn.
 - Sir John is wearing a great deal of perfume - a heavy stench of lavendar
 - The bell tower looks to be made of differnt coloured stone is really bright, when you're looking at it, everything stands in
 - Inn is obviously very abandoned
 - Big inn, sort that should be on a major thoroughfare
 - Flagstone floors
 - A big bar, lots of bottles, dusty, tables not wrecked, but abandoned, one corner that looks like it's been in use, a non dusty table and some mugs.
 - Some dice on the table.
 - Head upstairs
   - Almost another common room, passages off to rooms.
   - A bit damp smelling and daylight through bits of teh roof, mildewy smell.
   - A fair bit of bed linen, and the dap has got to it.

## Nervous affliction goes down
 - Tend not to allow 
 - Is Sir John strictly speaking a person?
 - Decide to head to the garden
   - Can hear some singing of someone singing to poisonous plants 
     - Person is Ribesal (referring to herself in 3rd person)
   - Is overgrown, with a little cottage, thatched roof, in quite good shape with an occupied shape to it, poppies in a window box and other plants.
   - Early spring, very unseasonably 
   - About 3feet tall, and is the strangest thing you've ever seen
     - Not a natural creature, but is a creature, my impression is quite friendly unless crossed, and if crossed would probably do devious horrible things to you, poisoned or stabbed in your sleep, fairly simple.
     - "If you need to poinson someone..."
       - Get Ribesil to describe itself
       - Head of an infant my nose has been fashioned for pleasure.
       - Do you know where the darling Bell Sam is? 
     - Lots of people went away when the darling bell damn went away 
     - 10 winters ago that the witch hunters came.
     - Sometimes silent bell, if people who didn't live here
     - Sometiems the fishermen come for milk of the poppy
     - And the Rev'd boyfriends sometimes come
     - The rev'd was here a few days ago
     - I knew sir John when he was alive, Dr. Fabula - sent quietus and Sir John to london to stop them building the cuts, but the witch hunters found them, he was even more dead when he came back
       - More than 10 seasons ago
       - There was a big battle
     - Silent bell arrived last night with Fabia (who lives in the village now)
     - Things in the garden are growing a lot better inside.
     - Walk the long way round past a nice 2 story building (unusual due to lack of stone) (Library)

       - There is a (church) bell in every arch...
       - Call oliver "York"
       - Big heavy iron knocker in the shape of a bell, very loud, but there isn't any answer
       - Sweary posh lady, looking for oil paintings, promising to "fuck us up if we interfere"
     - Meet silent bell and Fabia
     - Tell them about that the lady there are some quite powerful satanic artifacts if she's looking for those things then she's probably not of the orthodoxy.
     - There is a hell hound that protects that courtyard, that she's got passed somehow.
     - No one's been in there for 12 years
     - Would you like to come in for a bit of wine and a chat.
     - Head to the tower, big open plan kitchen, well tended, but not lived in for a while.
     - We can stay in any of the abandoned buildings.
     - 40 / 50 years ago, we're in the fens there was a little bit of a village, Dr.Fabularr came with some other people Quietus killed everyone here. 
     - It got built up as a bit of a haven in the middle of the fens, Sir John was a member of parliament - Scrimshaw brought sir John back with the idea of going to parliament and saying "nothing to see here"
     - Quietus was him and they got caught, Duke of Bedford had a commission adn control over the fenlands adn was going to build a big cut to drain the river ooze
     - Dr Fabular went to London was caught and then some witchfinders came and started to attack. The place was a bit too much for them. Here is a bad place for the orthodox lot...
     - We think that they believe all of Dr. Fabulars places.
     - We're between the old cut and the new cut.
     - We need to wait at least a month between using the druid stone. There's a risk of ceasing to be 
       - It would be good if this place became a community again.
       - Something else that I'm not going to explain.
       - The rev'd has gone.
         - There's someone else in the village who does not want to be disturbed.
         - There is a night watchman, we'll need someone to introduce us.
         - The streets are very safe at nicht if you belong here.
       - Oliver speaks in the voice of patience
       - How do I get to somewhere I can buy some shoes.
       - We really don't want you coming back if you leave the village
       - The intention was that this would be a thriving place where people who needed somewhere to come could come.
       - Probable that the drains are blocked.
       - Rev'd 's 2 artist friends
       - There are some other people who I might be able to get and sent back.
       - The mystro of sin - did wood cuts and oil paintings, there were a few around town.
       - Hell hound has teets
       - Might be able to teach us a way of disguising ourselves.
         - Fabia might be able to help with us having been beaten up.
         - Will do that this evening.
       - "That's the favour"
         - I will do everything to keep her safe - Nicholas
       - Might be able to teach us cantrips, little songs that do stuff.
       - Is there anywhere else we should stay. 
       - The church is for everybody, the vicarage is nearby.
         - Possible that his artist friends.

       - Filigree worked up there, and died at the battle of the cut (as did pretty much everybody)
       - Scrimshw is here alive but just bones.
       - Dr. Fabular "Everything taht was god or satan was a person and possibly a ubiety that was left behind. There are diffent orthodoxies.

       - We need to sort out food 
       - Silent bell will leave the door unlocked 
     - Head to the vicarage / church
       - Housing in the sink is quite rough...
     - Church and graveyard, overgrown statues and crypts
       - Church the door is open, most of the windows are gone, there's one left showing Jesus doing something.
     - A well maintained cottage, that's well maintained with an orchard.
     - Also overgrown fields
     - Knock on the vicarage and shout. Shelves of books, a table, looks really nice (twee)
     - A larger with a loaf of bread and some cheese, recently inhabitted.
     - Bedroom is completely different in tone... Rather racy pornography, looks like a brothel / boudour
     - Church is a Norman church, pews, cubby holes for shrines, space for a big stained glass window at the back, not clear if it's catholic or prodestant, bit more CofE of the era.
     - Big cross, Middle of the church is a huge magic circle with wyrds symbols and piled up are bones.
     - Windows went out cleanly
     - Were magic circles, not any more, someone a day or two ago did something, a demonic conjuration to get somethign into those bones.
     - Being from crossroads is solomons key and solomons seal, you need an idea of what you're going to summon.
     - Rev'd went at about the right time
  ## Spend my wyrd chit on the circles, they were summonning
 - We could head back and chat to people 
   - One of the pictures is a little demonic
     - And a whole different quality, masterfuly executed.
     -
