 - Sounds like one of the soldiers Cuthbert
 - Alias and other vet soldier followed by Gideon, dragging somebody who’s proper thin and bandaged up. They do have really good boots and interesting black metal gloves with flowers.

 - Gideon finds some pliers and pull out the persons eyes, that aren’t eyes, first a blue, then a green gem.
 - Gloves are metal hands, not gloves.

 - The bag they put the things in is given to Alias and they are going to be taken to a “Master Ignations” might be the German.

### Affliction Sad 
### Affliction Pain

 - Loaded back into wagon
 - Messenger has a conversation, order of our procession has been changed we won’t be burnt in Bristol at the milestone, all of these processions, will now end at the London milestone.
 - Discussions with the witchfinder general
 - We now just have Alias and two soldiers
 - Muddy by the river Avon
 - As it starts to get towards dusk stopped near a bit of a cottage, with a fishing boat.
 - Not been fed
### Affliction hungry 2
 - Shuffle off the shackles
### Affliction pain 2
 - Cottage is taken over
 - A low mist roles off the river, looks like smoke, puts the soldiers and fisherman to sleep
 - A boat glides out of the smoke with a single figure skulling on the boat, with 5 candles
 - A female figure jumps out of the boat, with extremely tight clothing yellow and blue with lots of bells. No noise from the bells dagger on her belt, bits and pieces, looks dodgy as fuck (but in a good way).
 - She’s wearing a mask, touches the lock the door opens reaches in to the person who you keep not noticing. 
 - Oliver dives past 
 - Chains come off all of us, is clearly magic
 - Person who we didn’t notice says 
 - Help everyone onto the boat
 - Can hear sound of a tinkling bell
 - Head down the river get some distance, is quite smokey / misty
 - End up on a river based pebble beach
 - Grounded on an island in the middle of the river…
 - About ½ a mile across there is a jaunty pavilion with some benches, bunting in blue and yellow. Seem to be some 
 - Loads of food out, that’s been there from last night.
 - Wine and food 2 glasses from the night before.
### Lose 1 hunger
 - 3 trees - Big willow, Thick giant beach tree covered in carvings and a black walnut.
 - Tents are richly appointed inside, proper glamping and implausible.
 - Not lived in, but were both slept in.
 - I and Agnes keep eating
 - **Can all read.**
 - Oliver looks at the tree
 - All been done by different people, mad snatches of occult lore.
 - Oliver starts to write on the tree
 - Nicholas talks about the 
### Lose the other hunger
 - Things that imply tools were used, but no tools
 - Look around, but find only things that add to comfort, a lot of food, but nothing to cook it on.
 - Witchfinder comes over
 - Not here to take you, would like a reasonable conversation.
 - “The burning was for your own good” 
 - I think that you escaped with the aid of one of Dr. Fabula’s henchmen.
 - Nicholas - I slpet with one of your soldiers
 - “If you cooperate, I’ll send you to France with some finances and you can live out your lives”
 - “Get the chains off my friends and I’ll tell you everything”
 - Tell me something as a taster…
 - “There was a hand of glory”
 - Breaks the chains on Agnes a bit too easily
 - Head smacked on table by Leo
### Affliction Bruse 1
 - Gets wits 
 - This guy is definitely not a witchfinder
 - Use the chit on Haruspex to find out that they are not the witchfinder
 - More concerned with our tongueless friend.
 - If you can follow her there is a place that she lives in that you can find a roof over your head.
 - What would you like, what would you like to do? He de-witchfinders himself a bit.
 - Breaks me out of chains
 - Agnes wants to learn - “Everything”
 - I’d like to never worry about money again
 - Don’t want anything from us at the moment, later…
 - “I am not the devil”
 - No such thing as fairies
 - The great trick is to put rules on thing / defining things they close down all the other possibilities.
 - When you make rules on things 
 - Those things all made by Dr. Fabular who is completely dead
 - We’d need to find her for sanctuary, she has left the route open.
 - Shouldn’t linger but no need to rush
 - Let’s get some rest\
 - Willow will eat your pain
 - Beach something carved will become true
 - Black walnut wood will help magical abilities
 - At some point you’ve broken free of the 
### Willow takes the pain afflications and grows 
 - Definitely the willow that takes the pain.
--
 - For next time…
 - Want to head to walnut ask it for a splinter I can use to carve in the 
 - Can’t inscribe - because I have no hands.
 - Have a splinter of wood
--
 - Wyrd talent will tell you if something is magic or not.
 - Could spend your wyrd chit to make it work.
 - These trees were planted by **Merdin Woodheart** - A druid from before the Romans.
 - Mr Not a Witchfinder.
### We warm up around the fire removing cold
 - Oliver 
 - 1 narrative point which should help us put together our story.
 - A moment in the past that I realise I was outside the orthodoxy.
 - Nicholas casts his spell, gets himself a bundle of clothes.
