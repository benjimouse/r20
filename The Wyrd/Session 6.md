    - They find a scarecrow, wearing an odd assortment of clothes
    - A woman - "Go away or I'll get my rats to eat you and take yourstuff" - "Tell Red T she can fuck off as well" - "I like smearing shit over things" - "Not interested in the library any more" - "Snakes vs Rats discussions"

      - Red Testement arrives, and talks about the shit - probably 
      - Tunnels that are flooded all under the village
      - Red thinks the scarecrow was creating the warding, she might disturb it.
    - After the battle of the Cut a fight in the university a lot of ubiety which were bound by Dr F in a way that sealed the library. The scarecrow is the centre of the binding, the ubiety is still bound but the warding ahs gone down, probably due to a trigger. There's a Ubiety in there that Red would like back.
    - There's also a Ubiety of Lily's something caused or triggered something to happen.
      - Embroidery - Clothes don't look like the Ubiety, creates all sorts of difficulties, don't bind Lily's ubiety.
      - Quite easy to bind your own but difficult to bind others.
      - Created by a lot of people really falling out.
      - Thinking about moving into the 3 cottages N of the inn.
        - Stone built with shutters, no stoves and no fireplaces.
        - Of a liveable for one or two person.
  - Move it forward a bit
    - Red Testement has a plan that she's going to check.
      - You lot are quite trustworthy and reasonable
      - Spend the day starting to make the places liveable - might start to make it extra liveable to get some auto welfare chits
      - Red - "I've spoken to a demon I know some sorcerry that should trap the ubieties.
      - I'm goign to trap them and then leave, one is Lily Maiden's and 
      - I will come back at some point and tell you.
        - They live in Lily's place and she's quite powerful.
        - In philgree's workshop, she made ragged's eye's there are 3 there, a perl, a piece of amathest, a piece of amber with a midge.
        - Going to leave the other painting behind
  - Haruspx the eyes, not going to just let her see, akin to the tongue replacements:
    - Perl wisdom and learning - helpfull in the reading dept
    - Ama healing and cleansing - more about seeing 
    - Amber really clar sense tha tteh mos could leave the eyeball
      - Amber is the more potent of the three
    - No particular compleity but keep the socket clean and ready
  ## spend H chit, fortune point and champagne happy
  - Plan to find fabia
  - ## Happy champagne welbeing
  - Fabia making something to get rid of the smell.
  - Table has been moved (not very far)
  - Couple of days pass, but the houses are going to get proper cold in winter.
    - Fabia cleans out Agnes's eyes
    - Sleep, but now in a place where you can sleep in your own homes
  - All livable, not great - Winter's going to be a problem as food will be.
  - Start with the perl into the eye socket, doesn't just afix on it's own, it tries.
    - Doesn't look very natural
  - Swans in the fens
    - Oliver studies the pond
  - Getting ready for bed
  - Silent Bell and a middle aged man, wearing black coming across the bridge.
    - They go into the tower
  - In the morning, we head to the tower, the rev'ds thing got sorted out
    - Need to start teaching us - 
    - We go to talk to the rev'd
    - He's in the church
      - We've had a bit of a rough time
      - Tidying up, but he asks what we've noticed.
      - Quietus killed everyone and buried them over there in the direction of the gnarled tree
      - You didn't notice the tops of the pillars
      - Big stack of firewood outside where the lads were, that we could use some of
      - Rev would like to build it up, he doesn't know too much 
      - What is community minded - live here, look after each other, everybody contributes
      - Persue our own interests, help each other 
      - Attacked we'll stand by each other 
      - Silent Bell teach us some of teh humdrum path
      - Ordinary Peter is the real expert with the humdrum path
        - He'll move back in if there are more people here.
      - A decent artisan could put scrimshaw back together again, still sentient, and really irritating. Would be able to bring back some corpses to do some work.
      - We could do with recruiting some people to be part of the community 
      - Cooks and labourers 
      - First steps 
      - Can be in covenly in a day (where Or Peter lives)
      - In the ouze washes, a strip of land, full of ditches, originally the wild fens, but Duke of Bedford had 2 canals, covenly is outside of the cuts. Extrodinarily difficult to do if it's obvious to an obsever.
      - Humdrum path lets you 
      - Try and stay clear of places
      - Washes from st. Ives to downham market those places are quite orthodox. Eely is a great centre of orthodxy.
      - Could use the druid stone to travel quite quickly.
      - He carved the spell for three island, you need a stick from each of the trees to get there.
      - Might see you for the service this (and every) evening
