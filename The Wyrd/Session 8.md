# Session 8
 - Plan to visit a tree
   - Oliver gives me a sack of poo and bones
   - Head to the boat, and then we're heading to a "tree"
 - Row to the tree - on a mound about 30 or 40' across
   - A twisted jagged thing
   - Jazz hands by an evil mime
   - The roots of the tree are holding the mound together, there are a lot of bones
   - There is a gap and a shovel
   - Hole place feels pretty spooky or 

## Dread one
 - The others get out of the boat
   - Oliver feeds the tree
   - Oliver summons an undead creature...
   - Tree wants someone to die on the island preferably via the plague
   - Tree island grasps at Agnes and huts her
- Back to the village, with the idea to learn the humdrum path
  - Need a quiet place with nothing peculiar going on 
  - Need to put out some things or adorn it with ordinary things from your previous life.
    - Something that you can feel
  - Start some lessons in the evening
  - ## Spend fortune point
  - Couple of silver knives, a fork and a spoon
  - Bottles with river water in it
    - A lot of sitting around, talking calmly, get into a mundane headspace.
  - Silent Belle is a really good teacher, Fabia is also good at it, but not so much at teaching, it's a well rehearsed set of lessons.
  - SB tells Nicholas that if you can't do this then you're not coming back.
  - Having to get to a headspace where everything is normal
  - ## Learn Humdrum path - On wyrd - By default in effect, will tend to mean that people don't notice there's anything weird about you. Have to chose to use it, if you do any wyrd stuff then it stops working
  - ## The ordinary traveller, a spell from humdrum path, need to engage, gives you a value that does the same thing as the humdrum path but you can get away with doing things that are a bit wyrd, but that will start to reduce. Conversations also reduce it.
  - In a couple of weeks she plans to show us how to travel the druid stones.
    - Monthly market in St Ives
      - Downham market is there all the time
      - We are going to need a lot of blood, prefer not human

    - A hand water pump - Courtyards by Shefield potteries
    - Buildings are 2 story
  - In the middle is a dog, the size of a shtland pony, is pitch black apart from it's eyes which are red and it's many 
  - Dog comes up to bite me I leap back down
  - Nick tries to tame the Hell hound
  - nick charms it a fair bit
  - Nick heads in
  - Hell hound watches and is a bit nerve inducing
  - Probably wouldn't take much to excite it.
  - A number of reasonably mundane workshops, tools of the trade are still there, the place is well built, a potters, stone masons, a printing press, including some printings of wood cuts, carpenters.
  - The plates were taken by Red Testement
  - Definitely a spot where a painting used to hang, 
  - Above the workshops, there are living qtr's which are still in a reasonable state, also a jewellers, above the printing press and the jewellers, there are more clothes, a lot of nice dresses.
  - jewellers contains quite a lot of semi-precious stones. Some boxes, some that once contained some eyes. One piece of jeweller that is hanging from a tree... A tiny cannon
  - A lot of dust around but disturbed on a table.... A green arabic cut glass cup
  - Set of lock picks from carpenter, jeweller, typesetter.
  - Badly cooked wood pigeon
  - Nearest town in that direction, Coveny is to the South East, about half way to Ely
    - About 3 miles to walk and Ely about 3 more miles, will have to cross the cut.
    - Try not to linger at the cut
      - Follow the causeway out of town, splits North and South. North to Downham Market
      - South to the cut and a drovers trail to a crossroads. Village of Coveny on a mound, you'll see a hill. Wouldn't go over that hill. At fork one way up the hill, one way to Coveny.
      - People who live up the hill, are a bit like us, Coveny is a place of the Orthodoxy.
      - Will really feel the orthodoxy when over the cut
      - Something about him that I feel I ought to tell you.

      - Humdrum path - down the causeway
      - We wend our way on a pleasant walk.
      - The cut is a deep canal with a wooden bridge
      - Looks not very well maintained
      - Cross bridge passive humdrom path goes down by the bridge, hands stop working.
      - Cut is very potent thing of the orthodoxy.
      - If there was someone watching would have been super difficult to sneak out.
      - A wagon a bit further than the crossroads
      - Three of four kids digging
      - An unmarked mile stone, a bit less orthodox around the stone, they are digging up peat
      - Pay us really very little attention

      - Some farming a few cattle and some pigs

      - A second young woman behind the counter, a little bit younger
      - A man passed out on the floor, short, red faced and a little bit portly, with some dried vomit a really flamboyant purple silk and purple silk hat.
      - ## First impression chit = pretty convinced that's ordinary peter, will probably quite like him, presently sleeping off too much booze, clearly has been for some time.
      - Oliver helps him up, now the 2 women completely blank us.
      - He says it's not for him, not that safe, would like us to have some more people.
