<h2 id="page-1">Page 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many years ago I was born in the palace allotments.</li>
<li>I had a tingle like I was going to be special</li>
<li>The next day we were going to be in a new recipe called the two pan shan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just before the cook picked me up the queen picked me from the pile</li>
<li>This was the moment I was going to be part of something special</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>The queen was nagging her son about him marrying a bride.</li>
<li>One year passed and the queen stormed off into the kitchen and came back with me in my pot.</li>
<li>And put me under 20 mattresses because she thought a real princess would be able to feel me under 20 mattresses but I think that's crazy so I helped with the last one. We'll come back to that later though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the morning all of the princesses were asked how they slept and they always said... They had a brilliant sleep, &quot;what a comfy bed.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>One night a terrible storm struck our kingdom.</li>
<li>And suddenly a knock was at the door.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-6">Page 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>A small wet person walked in, the queen gasped &quot;I bet this is the real princess&quot; she said.</li>
<li>Before she could say a word the small wet person got put to bed on the 20 mattresses and me of course.</li>
<li>I knew I needed to help, this is what I was explaining earlier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-7">Page 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>I climbed up to where she was sleeping and I said...</li>
<li>&quot;There's a big arch thing underneath you&quot; and I told her about this huge arch thing for 3 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-8">Page 8</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the morning, like all princesses, she was asked &quot;how did she sleep?&quot;</li>
<li>But this time it was different, she complained:</li>
<li>&quot;Oh, it was terrible, a big arch thing was bothering me all night.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-9">Page 9</h2>
<ul>
<li>They got married and the wedding was brilliant.</li>
<li>The queen was interested to meet the new princesses family.</li>
<li>And I Hope they will have a very happy life</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-10">Page 10</h2>
<ul>
<li>And as for me...</li>
<li>I became a very important artifact and I have my own glass cage.</li>
<li>And some people even love me</li>
</ul>
