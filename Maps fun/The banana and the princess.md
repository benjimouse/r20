# The banana and the princess

## Page 1
 - Many years ago I was born in the palace allotments.
 - I had a tingle like I was going to be special
 - The next day we were going to be in a new recipe called the two pan shan.

 - Just before the cook picked me up the queen picked me from the pile
 - This was the moment I was going to be part of something special

## Page 3
 - The queen was nagging her son about him marrying a bride.
 - One year passed and the queen stormed off into the kitchen and came back with me in my pot.
 - And put me under 20 mattresses because she thought a real princess would be able to feel me under 20 mattresses but I think that's crazy so I helped with the last one. We'll come back to that later though.

 - In the morning all of the princesses were asked how they slept and they always said... They had a brilliant sleep, "what a comfy bed."

 - One night a terrible storm struck our kingdom.
 - And suddenly a knock was at the door.

## Page 6
 - A small wet person walked in, the queen gasped "I bet this is the real princess" she said.
 - Before she could say a word the small wet person got put to bed on the 20 mattresses and me of course.
 - I knew I needed to help, this is what I was explaining earlier.

 - I climbed up to where she was sleeping and I said...
 - "There's a big arch thing underneath you" and I told her about this huge arch thing for 3 hours.

## Page 8
 - In the morning, like all princesses, she was asked "how did she sleep?"
 - But this time it was different, she complained:
 - "Oh, it was terrible, a big arch thing was bothering me all night."

 - They got married and the wedding was brilliant.
 - The queen was interested to meet the new princesses family.
 - And I Hope they will have a very happy life

 - And as for me...
 - I became a very important artifact and I have my own glass cage.
 - And some people even love me
